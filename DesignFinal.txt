Function Name: Menu
Parameters: None
Return: Menu Choice
Algorithm:
1. Output options: "What type of sport: football, quidditch, gymnast:"
2. Ask user to choose
3. Return menu choose


Function Name: football
Parameters: interceptions, completions, attempts, passing_yards, touchdown_passes
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1.Ask user to input Parameter: "interceptions"
2.Ask user to input Parameter: "completions"
3.Ask user to input Parameter: "attempts"
4.Ask user to input Parameter: "passing_yards"
5.Ask user to input Parameter: "touchdown_passes"
6. Calculation: "100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing_yards/attempts-3) + 20(touchdown_passes/attempts)
+ 2.375 – (25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6"
7. Return calculation from step 3


Function Name: quidditch
Parameters: goal, snitch

Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "goal"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "snitch"
2. Calculation: "(10(goal)) + (30(snitch))"
3. Return calculation from step 3


Function Name: gymnast
Parameters: difficulty, execution1, execution2, execution3, execution4, execution5
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "difficulty"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "execution1"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "execution2"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "execution3"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "execution4"
1. Ask user to input Parameter: "execution5"
2. Take out the max exeuction and the min execution
3. Calculation: "(difficulty) + ((execution1 + execution2 + execution3 + execution4 + execution5) / (5))"
4. Return calculation from step 3
