3. Ask user to input completions: ("Please enter your number of completions made.")
4. Call int_check to check for valid interger
5. Ask user to input attempts: ("Please enter your number of attempts made.")
6. Call int_check to check for valid interger
7. Ask user to input passing_yards: ("Please enter your number of passing yards made.")
8. Call int_check to check for valid interger
9. Ask user to input touchdown_passes: ("Please enter your number of touchdown passes made.")
10. Call int_check to check for valid interger
11. Calculate football_score: ("100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing_yards/attempts-3) +
  20(touchdown_passes/attempts) + 2.375 – (25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6")
12. Return football_score

Parameters: goal, snitch
Return: quidditch_score
Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input goals: ("Please enter your number of goals made.")
2. Call int_check to check for valid interger
4. Calculate quidditch_score: "(10(goal)"
5. Ask user to input snitch: ("Did you catch the golden snitch? yes or no?")
6. Call int_check to check for valid interger
7. If snitch is equal to "yes"
    a. Add 30 to quidditch_score
8. Else:
    a. Add 0 to quidditch_score
11. Return quidditch_score


Function Name: gymnast
Parameters: difficulty, execution1, execution2, execution3, execution4, execution5
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input difficulty: ("Please enter difficulty score.")
2. Call execution1 function: ("Please enter execution1 score."))
3. Call execution2 function: ("Please enter execution2 score."))
4. Call execution3 function: ("Please enter execution3 score."))
5. Call execution4 function: ("Please enter execution4 score."))
6. Call execution5 function: ("Please enter execution5 score."))
7. Call for min_value for calculation
8. Call for max-value for calculation
9. Calculate average_executions: "((execution1 + execution2 + execution3 + execution4 + execution5) - (min_value +
max_value)) / 5 "
10. Calculate_Gym = "(difficulty) + (average_executions)"
11. Return Calculation_Gym

Function Name: calculate_min
Parameters: execuation1, execuation2, execuation3, execuation4, execuation5
Return: min_value
Algorithm:
1. Set min_value to execuation1
2. If execuation2 is less than min_value:
    a. Set min_value to execuation2
3. If execuation3 is less than min_value:
    a. Set min_value to execuation3
4. If execuation4 is less than min_value:
    a. Set min_value to execuation4
5. If execuation5 is less than min_value:
    a. Set min_value to execuation5
6. Return min_value

Function Name: calculate_max
Parameters: execuation1, execuation2, execuation3, execuation4, execuation5
Return: max_value
Algorithm:
1. Set max_value to execuation1
2. If execuation2 is greater than max_value:
    a. Set max_value to execuation2
3. If execuation3 is greater than max_value:
    a. Set max_value to execuation3
4. If execuation4 is greater than max_value:
    a. Set max_value to execuation4
5. If execuation5 is greater than max_value:
    a. Set max_value to execuation5
6. Return max_value


Function Name: Main
Parameters: None
Return: None
Algorithm:
1. Tell the user the purpose of the program: "This program will calculate various sports statistics for the user, based
on the user’s choice of sport."
2. Call menu
3. If menu_choice is equal to "football":
    a. Call football
    b. Output: ("Your football QB rating is", football_score)
    c. If football_score is equal to 158.3
        i.Output: "You are a perfect passer."
    d. Otherwise:
        a. Output: "Sorry, you are not considered a perfect passer."
4. Otherwise/If menu_choice is equal to "quidditch":
    a. Call quidditch
    b. Output: ("Your score for Quidditch is", quidditch_score)
5. Otherwise:
    a. Call gymnast
