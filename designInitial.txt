Function Name: Input type of sport
Parameters: None
Return: input purpose of each sport
Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input type of sport: "american football, quidditch, gymnast:"
2. Error check lower
3. Return input purpose of each sport as string

Function Name: american football
Parameters: interceptions, completions, attempts, passing_yards, touchdown_passes
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1. Output Purpose: "This will tell you whether or not the Quarter Back is a perfect passer."
2.Ask user to input Parameters: "interceptions, completions, attempts, passing_yards, touchdown_passes"
3. Calculation: "100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing_yards/attempts-3) + 20(touchdown_passes/attempts)
+ 2.375 – (25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6"
4. return calculation from step 3

Function Name: quidditch
Parameters: goal, snitch
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1. Output Purpose: "This will tell you the score of a team in the game of quidditch."
2. Ask user to input Parameters: "goal, snitch"
3. Calculation: "(10(goal)) + (30(snitch))"
4. return calculation from step 3

Function Name: gymnast
Parameters: difficulty, execution1, execution2, execution3, execution4, execution5
Return: Calculation of Parameters
Algorithm:
1. Output Purpose: "This will tell the final score for a gymnast on any apparatus."
2. Ask user to input Parameters: "difficulty, execution1, execution2, execution3, execution4, execution5.
3. Calculation: "(difficulty) + ((execution1 + execution2 + execution3 + execution4 + execution5) / (5))"
4. return calculation from step 3
