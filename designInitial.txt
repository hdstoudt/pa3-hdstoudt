Function Name: Menu
Parameters: None
Return: Menu Choice
Algorithm:
1. Output options: "What type of sport: american football, quidditch, gymnast:""
2. Ask user to choose
3. if sport is american football:
    a. sport = "100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing_yards/attempts-3) + 20(touchdown_passes/attempts)
    + 2.375 – (25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6"
4. elif sport is quidditch:
    a.sport = "(10(goal)) + (30(snitch))"
5. otherwise if the sport is gymnast:
    a. sport = "(difficulty) + ((execution1 + execution2 + execution3 + execution4 + execution5) / (5))"
6. Otherwise:
    a.Output: "invalid entry"
    b sport = 0
3. Return input purpose of each sport as string
